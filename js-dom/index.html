    <p>This is usually accomplished in three ways: Reading, Reflecting and Experimenting.</p> <h4>READ</h4><p>Whether it’s reading people’s faces, emotions or between the lines, you have a lot to gain by dedicating at least five hours in your week to reading.He does it as a way to relate to people better — to understand why people behave the way that they do.</p> <h4>REFLECT</h4><p>In Mr. Robot’s sophomore season premiere, Elliot journals every thought that he is having, as he is having it. This moment allows the viewer some incredible insight into how his mind works.</p> <strong>In many instances, self reflection gives you essential information about yourself that you simply would not have access to unless you sat down in silence.</strong> <h4>EXPERIMENT</h4> <p>Elliot informs us that he has a “perfectly constructed loop” in which he has an almost mind numbing — and I guess that’s the purpose, routine where he does what he perceives “normal” people do daily. With a twist!</p> <p>Anyway, the takeaway from this is disrupt your routine!</p><p>Get lost! I mean that literally. As in, take a different route to work, or maybe something different for a week. Experiment with new ideas, new concepts and never stay the same.</p>
